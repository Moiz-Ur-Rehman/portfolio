                <p>I developed a registration and login system with secure password i.e. password hashing. Along with the login system I made the front end of user's dashboard in which the top menu was dynamic/editable. A one page admin panel was also developed through which the admin/owner can customize the top menu.
                    <br>Technologies used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
